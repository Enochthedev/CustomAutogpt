# Custom Auto-GPT in .NET - Deliverables

## 1. Project Overview
Custom Auto-GPT in .NET is an AI-powered autonomous agent designed for ERP automation. 
It integrates with the GEMS ERP system, sandboxing AI instances for each tenant to ensure data isolation.

## 2. Core Features
- **Task Decomposition:** Breaks down user requests into sub-tasks and executes them autonomously.
- **Multi-Tenant AI Isolation:** Ensures that AI models do not share data across tenants.
- **Memory Management:** Implements short-term and long-term memory using vector storage and databases.
- **LLM Integration:** Supports OpenAI, local AI models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **Task Execution Engine:** Handles background jobs, automation, and API interactions.
- **Secure Sandboxing:** Uses per-tenant instance separation via containerization.

## 3. Technical Architecture
- **Tech Stack:** .NET 8 (C#), ASP.NET Core, RabbitMQ/Kafka, PostgreSQL/NoSQL, Docker, LangChain.NET.
- **AI Processing:** Uses LLMs for task execution and decision-making.
- **Event-Driven Workflow:** Microservices communicate via RabbitMQ.

## 4. Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Core Development (Weeks 1-4)
- Setup project structure & architecture.
- Implement AI Orchestration & Memory Management.

### Phase 2: AI Task Execution (Weeks 5-8)
- Build Task Manager & Decision System.
- Integrate AI models & RAG.

### Phase 3: ERP Integration (Weeks 9-12)
- Implement API connectors for GEMS ERP modules.
- Deploy and test tenant sandboxing.
